# Subscription

### What payment methods do you accept?

We currently only accept [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/) for all plans. Secure payment processing ensures that your transactions are safe and easy.
If you want to suggest a payment platform to implement in RayFlat, do not hesitate to send an email to [feedback@rayflat.com](maito:feedback@rayflat.com).

### How does the payment process work?

We use a subscription system through [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/). This method automates payments at regular intervals (monthly or yearly), ensuring that your membership remains active without interruptions.

When you make your first purchase:

Subscription Setup:
1. Plan Selection: Choose the plan that best suits your needs (monthly or annual).
2. You will be prompted to create a PayPal account or link your existing account.
3. Payment Information: Enter your credit or debit card information associated with your PayPal account.
4. Confirmation: Review your subscription details and confirm your purchase.

Processing Recurring Payments:

- Renewal Date: The [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/) system will automatically charge the amount corresponding to your subscription on the renewal date set.
- Notifications: You will receive an email each time a payment is processed.
- Cancellation: You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Once cancelled, you will retain access to the benefits of your plan until the end of your billing period.

### Can I switch between the Pro and Gold plans?

Yes, you can switch between the Pro and Gold plans at any time. The Gold plan offers a discounted rate for those who choose the annual billing option.

### Are there any hidden fees?

No, there are no hidden fees. All pricing is clear and we won't charge you more than the amount agreed upon in the plan.

### Do I have a trial period before I'm charged?

Currently, we don't offer a trial period. However, you can start with the free plan to explore the core features at no cost and decide later if you want to upgrade to a paid plan.
